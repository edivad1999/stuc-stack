### Runtime forensics

**You own the diagnosis. Instrument the live process, don't theorize from source.** The deliverable is a cited diagnosis, not a fix.

1. Capture the live signal on the matching surface via **android-verify**: a Perfetto or Studio CPU profile for a spinning process, a heap dump for a leak, an `android screen` / layout capture for a visual glitch. A real artifact, not a guess. Do not call `control-ui` or `control-cli`.
2. Reduce the artifact to the smoking gun: the function on the hot path, the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root, the loop firing without input. Parse large artifacts in a subagent (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill), keep the reduced finding in the main thread. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section.
3. Prove the mechanism before believing it. Inject logcat or `android` probes on the running process, or hotfix the live code without reinstalling the APK, to confirm the hypothesis cheaply.
4. Map the finding back to source: file, symbol, the line that allocates or schedules.
5. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the signal captured, the reduced finding, how you proved the mechanism, the source location, artifact paths. No fix unless asked. Hand back to Bug fix or Perf once the cause is known.
